### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: The Divergence in The School of Athens (A NLP Project)
+ This project is conducted by Denise Rahmadina 

+ Project summary: One of the most famous frescoes in the entire world is the School of Athens. It is a Renaissance masterpiece created by Raphael between 1509 and 1511 and features the famous philosophers of the classical age. Even though there is a lot to discuss in this fresco, I want to draw your attention to the two main figures (picture above) : Plato pointing to the skies and his student Aristotle pointing in the earthward direction. One of the most famous frescoes in the entire world is the School of Athens. The main difference between Plato and Aristotle philosophy is that the philosophy of Plato is more theoretical and abstract in nature, whereas the philosophy of Aristotle is more practical and experimental in nature. This analysis is conducted to identify the divergences between these two philosophers through their writings. This Project includes several NLP Analysis : 
+ 1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
+ 2. Sentiment Analysis 
+ 3. Topic Modelling 
+ 4. Readibility Index
